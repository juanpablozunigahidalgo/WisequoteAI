#Guide
This is an experimental website to call quotes and display them. 
It uses typed.js 
The play was to use unlimited and non repeteable quotes from chat GPT. 
But it costs and I would rather keep it free. 
The quotes displayed are from : https://type.fit/api/quotes
Typed js is a free libriary that display text in a quite cool way. I like it. 
That is it dudes. Use this stuff.
